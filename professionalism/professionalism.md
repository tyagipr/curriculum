      - Eg: Someone may be offended by something you think is funny<br>

- Guidelines for all employees:-<br>
      1. No profanity and insensitive language / imagery on clothing<br>
      2. No ripped pants or shirts , regardless if they are in fashion<br>

#### Makeup on the Workplace
  - Wearing makeup to work is your choice

#### Arriving at Work
  - Your team or company will tell you what “on time” means<br>
  - If you have a planned absence or planned late arrival:<br>
      - Notify affected colleagues as soon as you are aware<br>
      - Notify affected colleagues again 1-2 days before the event<br>
  - If you will be unexpectedly late, notify affected colleagues ASAP and well before the time they are expecting you to arrive<br>
  - Arrive early enough to give yourself time to get settled before the start of a workday or a meeting
  
#### During the WorkDay
  - Be timely with your assignments<br>
      - When you are assigned a project or a task, work with your team or manager to determine a reasonable deadline<br>
      - Ensure you have the resources, skills and tools you’ll need to complete it by the deadline<br>
        - If you don’t have what you need, ask for it<br>
      - If you can’t make a deadline, let those affected know as soon as you realize it<br>
        - They may be able to help you<br>
        - Or, they can help you set a new deadline<br>
      - Don’t make promises you can’t keep. Be realistic.
      
#### Leave Work
  - Companies expect you to put in 8 good hours of work each day<br>
  - Plan to be at work for 9 hours, since lunch takes up 1 extra hour<br>
  - Finish the tasks you were assigned for the day before you go home<br>
  - Some teams or managers may be OK with occasionally leaving early to attend industry-related events<br>
  - It is considered rude to say things like, “Time to get the ---- out of here!” or “I’m so glad I get to go home now.”

#### Music at Work
  - Music is generally only permitted with the use of headphones
      - Headphones sometimes indicate someone does not want to be disturbed
  - Make sure that no one can hear your music even if you are using headphones
  - If music is played publicly, soft instrumental music is generally best to allow people to focus
      - No words or harsh instruments
      - “Café” music, jazz, easy listening, classical guitar, piano

### Common Mistakes / Misconceptions
- **"This is irrelevant to me right now because I'm an apprentice. I'll start acting professionally once I'm hired."** Many serious athletes "practice like they play", meaning they approach their practice and training with as much seriousness and intensity as they'd put in during a real game. This makes them well-prepared for game days. Techtonica has a similar approach, and we expect apprentices to "practice like they play".
- **"If someone tells me to behave professionally, they are telling me to act more like an higher-income white person."** If someone tells you to behave more professionally, they are referring to the (sometimes unwritten) behaviors outlined in this lesson. These behaviors are generally accepted across industries, roles and employment types to be "professional".
- **"Behaving professionally makes me appear weak."** Behaving professionally demonstrates that you value your role, your team, your employer and are conscientious.
- **"I cannot be my authentic self and behave professionally."** Being yourself and behaving professionally are not mutually exclusive. Sometimes, the "professional" you is one part of your true self who gets to come out at work, while other parts of your true self get to come out at other times. 
- **"It won't matter what I do or how I act because I'll just be a junior software engineer after Techtonica."** Junior software engineers are valued team members and are held to the same standard of professionalism as everyone else at the company. Behaving professionally demonstrates that you value your role, your team, your employer and are conscientious. Start your reputation off on good footing.


### Group Practice

1. On their own, each person writes a text message to a team member saying they're running late to a meeting. Then, each person shares their message aloud with the group.

2. On their own, each person writes an email to a manager notifying them that they'll be out of the office on some future date. Then, each person shares their message aloud with the group.

3. On their own, each person writes an email to a manager notifying them that they won't be finished with a project by the agreed-upon deadline. Then, each person shares their message aloud with the group.


### Independent Practice

1. Find a partner. Take turns role playing the following scenario: One of you is a team member and you need to tell your manager in person that you'll be missing a week of work next month. The other person is the manager and should express disappointment that the team member will be gone, but also express that you understand. Be sure to switch roles.

2. Find a partner. Take turns role playing the following scenario: One of you is a team member and you need to tell your manager in person that your project is likely not going to be finished by the agreed-upon deadline. The other person is the manager and should express unhappiness about this, but also work together to come up with a new, reasonable deadline or some other alternative (reduce the scope of the project or get help from a team member). Be sure to switch roles.
